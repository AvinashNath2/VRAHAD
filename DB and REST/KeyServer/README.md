	1. fingerprints (contains JSON only tuple for storing unique ID for all the authorized systems of Aadhar Center which are submitted by the Aadhar Center SPOC , each tuple has 2 attributes (SPOCID , Fingerprint) )
	
	# SPOCID will be given at time of registering which will have a password associated to it 
	# (Not our Headache unless mentor asks for it in Hackathon)
